# Final Action Plan: 90-Day Pivot

## Executive Summary

After deep market research and Socratic analysis, the recommended path is clear:

**Stop building Pro tier features. Start building audience and consulting practice.**

The memory tools (momentum, memory-mcp) should remain free forever. Monetization comes from expertise, not infrastructure.

---

## The Research Findings (Summary)

### What We Learned

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Mem0 raised $24M, has 41K stars | Memory infrastructure is winner-take-most |
| 575 downloads/month vs 13M+ for Mem0 | User base too small for SaaS |
| Claude Code courses already exist | Course market is saturated |
| AI consulting rates: $150-500/hr | Consulting is viable NOW |
| Context loss is #1 pain point | momentum solves this, but Anthropic may build native |
| Pro tier features are DIY-able | Cloud sync = Dropbox folder, 5 minutes |

### The Hard Truth

- **Pro tier as designed won't work** - Features are commoditized
- **Course market is crowded** - Udemy, Coursera, Anthropic official training
- **Memory tools are valuable** - But as lead generation, not revenue
- **The website IS the product** - substratia.io drives traffic, traffic converts to services

---

## The Pivot

### From This:
```
SUBSTRATIA = Memory Infrastructure Company
├── Products: momentum, memory-mcp
├── Revenue: Pro subscriptions ($15/mo)
└── Model: Open-core SaaS
```

### To This:
```
SUBSTRATIA = Claude Code Productivity Hub
├── Free tools: 11 tools (traffic magnets)
├── Free memory: momentum, memory-mcp (lead gen)
├── Content: Reviews, guides, tutorials (SEO authority)
├── Community: Newsletter (audience)
└── Revenue: Consulting first, courses later
```
