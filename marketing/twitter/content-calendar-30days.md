## Week 1: Foundation

### Day 1 (Monday)
**Type:** Tip
```
Claude Code tip #1:

Your CLAUDE.md needs a "DO NOT" section.

Example:
- Don't add comments to unchanged code
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't commit without tests

Negative constraints work better than positive ones.

What's in yours?
```

### Day 2 (Tuesday)
**Type:** Thread (7 tweets)
```
🧵 7 Claude Code shortcuts that save me 30+ minutes daily:

1/7
```

```
Ctrl+C - Interrupt Claude mid-response

When Claude is heading the wrong direction, don't wait.
Hit Ctrl+C and course correct.

2/7
```

```
/cost - Check token usage

Run this before complex operations.
Know when you're approaching limits.

3/7
```

```
/compact - Manual compaction

Trigger compaction on YOUR terms.
Better than waiting for auto-compaction.

4/7
```

```
Shift+Tab - Multi-line input toggle

Switch between single-line and multi-line.
Essential for complex prompts.

5/7
```

```
Up Arrow - Recall previous prompts

Edit and rerun previous prompts.
Iterate faster.

6/7
```

```
/clear - Fresh context

Sometimes a reset beats fighting drift.
Save state first (ask Claude to summarize).

7/7
```

```
All these and more in one printable page:

What shortcuts am I missing?
```

### Day 3 (Wednesday)
**Type:** Tool announcement
```
Made a free Claude Code cheat sheet:

📋 Slash commands
⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts
📝 CLAUDE.md patterns
🔧 MCP configuration

Print it. Bookmark it.

substratia.io/tools/cheat-sheet
```

### Day 4 (Thursday)
**Type:** Tip
```
The #1 Claude Code mistake I see:

"Fix that bug we talked about"

vs

"Fix the null pointer in handleSubmit() at line 42 of UserForm.tsx"

Context isn't remembered. Be explicit.
```

### Day 5 (Friday)
**Type:** Engagement
```
What's your biggest Claude Code frustration?

Mine was context loss. Sessions would fill up. Details would vanish.

Now I checkpoint before compaction.

Reply with yours 👇
```

### Day 6 (Saturday)
**Type:** Deep content
```
Context management is the hidden skill of AI-assisted development.

Two developers, same tools, wildly different results.

The difference? How they manage context.

I wrote a 12-min deep dive:
substratia.io/blog/context-management-guide
```

### Day 7 (Sunday)
**Type:** Rest / engage with replies

## Week 2: Authority Building

### Day 8 (Monday)
**Type:** Tip
```
Claude Code CLAUDE.md structure that works:

1. Overview (2-3 sentences)
2. Key directories
3. Coding standards
4. Current focus
5. Session notes
6. DO NOT section

Keep it under 3000 tokens. Bloat wastes context.
```

### Day 9 (Tuesday)
**Type:** Behind the scenes
```
I tracked my Claude Code sessions for a month.

Finding: 15-20 minutes lost per session to context issues.

That's 1-2 hours daily for heavy users.

The fix is simple. Just not obvious.
```

### Day 10 (Wednesday)
**Type:** Tool
```
Free tool: Claude Code Cost Calculator

Track session costs
Compare API vs subscription
Find your most cost-effective option

substratia.io/tools/cost-calculator
```

### Day 11 (Thursday)
**Type:** Tip
```
Before running /clear in Claude Code:

1. Ask Claude to summarize the session
2. Save to CLAUDE.md under "Session Notes"
3. Commit working changes

Then clear.

Future you will thank you.
```

### Day 12 (Friday)
**Type:** Engagement
```
Hot take: Most CLAUDE.md files are too long.

If yours is over 3000 tokens, you're wasting context.

Keep it focused. Keep it current.

Agree or disagree?
```

### Day 13 (Saturday)
**Type:** Resource
```
Claude Code resources I wish existed when I started:

1. Cheat sheet with all commands
2. Context management guide
3. CLAUDE.md templates

So I made them.

All free: substratia.io/tools
```

### Day 14 (Sunday)
**Type:** Rest / engage with replies

## Week 3: Expertise Demonstration

### Day 15 (Monday)
**Type:** Tip
```
Claude Code trick: Periodic checkpoints

Every 20-30 minutes, ask:
"Summarize: files modified, decisions made, what's pending"

Save to CLAUDE.md.

When compaction hits, you won't lose everything.
```

### Day 16 (Tuesday)
**Type:** Thread - MCP basics
```
🧵 MCP servers explained in 5 tweets:

What they are, why they matter, how to use them.

1/5
```

```
MCP = Model Context Protocol

A standard for connecting AI to external tools.

Think plugins, but standardized.

2/5
```

```
Example: memory-mcp

Gives Claude persistent memory across sessions.

Claude can store facts today, recall them tomorrow.

3/5
```

```
Example: momentum

Takes snapshots of your work.

Restores context in <5ms after /clear.

4/5
```

```
How to configure:

Edit ~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json

Add your MCP servers.

Restart Claude Code.

5/5
```

```

### Day 17 (Wednesday)
**Type:** Tool
```
Free: Claude Code Prompt Optimizer

- Thinking modes (ultrathink, thinkhard)
- Autonomous loop patterns
- Parallel execution snippets

substratia.io/tools/prompt-optimizer
```

### Day 18 (Thursday)
**Type:** Tip
```
The ultrathink pattern for complex decisions:

"Use extended thinking. Before answering, consider:
- 3 alternative approaches
- Trade-offs of each
- Long-term implications

Then recommend one with reasoning."
```

### Day 19 (Friday)
**Type:** Engagement
```
Question for Claude Code users:

What's ONE thing you wish Claude would stop doing?

I'll start: Adding helpful comments to code I didn't ask it to touch.

Your turn 👇
```

### Day 20 (Saturday)

## Week 4: Growth Push

### Day 22 (Monday)
**Type:** Tip
```
Claude Code prompting tip:

Start with the file path.

"In src/lib/auth.ts, update the token validation to..."

Claude knows exactly where to look. No ambiguity.
```

### Day 23 (Tuesday)
**Type:** Thread - Common mistakes
```
🧵 5 Claude Code mistakes I made (so you don't have to):

1/5
```

```
Mistake 1: Trusting memory

"Remember that refactor we discussed?"

Claude doesn't remember like you think.

Fix: Be explicit. Include context in every prompt.

2/5
```

```
Mistake 2: Fighting context drift

After 30+ minutes, context gets stale.

Sometimes /clear + fresh start beats fighting it.

3/5
```

```
Mistake 3: Ignoring /cost

Surprise compaction is the worst.

Check /cost regularly. Plan for limits.

4/5
```

```
Mistake 4: Bloated CLAUDE.md

Everything in there? Nothing is effective.

Keep it focused. Under 3000 tokens.

5/5
```

```
Mistake 5: No checkpoints

Compaction happens. Details vanish.

Checkpoint before it hits.

### Day 25 (Thursday)
**Type:** Tip
```
Claude Code workflow: Task isolation

One task, one focus.

Before starting a new task:
1. Commit changes
2. Update CLAUDE.md
3. Consider /clear

Clean context > cluttered context
```

### Day 26 (Friday)
**Type:** Engagement
```
Best Claude Code tip you've discovered this month?

Share below 👇

I'll RT the best ones.
```

### Day 27 (Saturday)
**Type:** Deep content
```
Why most context management advice fails:

It focuses on symptoms, not causes.

The cause: treating AI memory like human memory.

It's not. It's a window. It fills. It compresses.

Work WITH the constraint, not against it.
```

### Day 28 (Sunday)
**Type:** Rest / engage with replies

### Day 29 (Monday)
**Type:** Tip
```
Quick CLAUDE.md wins:

✅ "Current Focus" section (what you're working on NOW)
✅ "DO NOT" section (negative constraints)
✅ Session notes (updated each session)

These three things make a huge difference.
```

### Day 30 (Tuesday)
**Type:** Summary
```
30 days of Claude Code tips.

Top 3 takeaways:

1. Context isn't memory. Be explicit.
2. CLAUDE.md is your anchor. Keep it focused.
3. Checkpoint before compaction. Save your work.
